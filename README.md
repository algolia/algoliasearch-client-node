# deprecated

This repository previously hosted the AlgoliaSearch node.js client
(named `algolia-search` in npm).

We recently released a [new JavaScript client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-js) that
can be used with Node.js and the browser.

If you want to upgrade to the new version, read the [migration guide](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-js/wiki/Node.js-v1.x.x-migration-guide).

You can still use the 1.x.x version of the `algolia-search`, the readme is in [the V1 branch](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-node/tree/V1).
